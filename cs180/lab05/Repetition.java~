     * 
     * Type char( like byte & short) is an integral type. 
     * Which means:
     *     - it is internally represented as an integer,and hence can accept integer arithmetic and logical operations.
     *     - A variable of type char initialized to value 'a' is internally represented as 97 
     *       (you can verify that by printing a variable of type char as an integer). 
     *     - Adding 1 to a char of value 'a' will yield 98 which is the representation of char 'b'.
      *    - The expression ('a' < 'z') is a valid boolean expression that evaluates to true.

     * 
     *  - Print out ?Enter scores now:?
     *  - Takes in scores (ints) from the user until they 
     *     enter a -1.
     *  - After the user enters -1, you will print out the
     *     lowest score, the highest score, and the average 
     *     of the scores (rounded to the floor, or greatest integer not exceeding the average).
     *     See the format outlined in the instructions' sample execution.
     * 
     * Hints 
     *  - You can calculate the average by maintaining the sum of all the grades and the count
     *    of all the grades and only calculating the average when the user is done supplying the grades.
     *  - Maintain one variable for each statistic (count, sum, lowest, highest), 
     *    updating each of them for each grade entered.
     *  - When printing the output; note that the output statistics are right justified.
